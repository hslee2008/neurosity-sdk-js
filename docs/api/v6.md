title: Migrating from v5 to v6
---

The new version 6 of the SDK is mostly backwards compatible with v5.

There are 2 major changes required.

The most important change is the new renamed npm package and the name of the main SDK class.

Before:

```ts
import { Notion } from "@neurosity/notion";

const notion = new Notion();
```

After:

```ts
import { Neurosity } from "@neurosity/sdk";

const neurosity = new Neurosity();
```

Aside from this change, we've removed the following local mode functions in favor of the new Bluetooth support:

- `enableLocalMode`
- `isLocalMode`

If you are interested in supporting Bluetooth for your app, you can check out the [Bluetooth tutorial](/docs/api/streaming).
